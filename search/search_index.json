This means that the model correctly identified the context and location of the code to be changed.</p> <p>2) \"Compilation\" - Using static code analysis, Qodo Merge verifies that after applying the suggestion, the modified file will still be valid, meaning tree-sitter syntax processing will not throw an error. This process is relevant for multiple programming languages, see here for the full list of supported languages.</p> <p>When a suggestion fails to meet these validation criteria, it may still provide valuable feedback, but isn't suitable for direct application to the PR. In such cases, Qodo Merge will omit the 'apply' checkbox and instead display:</p> <p><code>[To ensure code accuracy, apply this suggestion manually]</code></p> <p>All suggestions that pass these validations undergo a final stage of self-reflection, where the AI model evaluates, scores, and re-ranks its own suggestions, eliminating any that are irrelevant or incorrect.

It reduces noise through several approaches:</p> <ul> <li>Auto-feedback uses three highly structured tools (<code>/describe</code>, <code>/review</code>, and <code>/improve</code>), designed to be accessible at a glance without creating large visual overload</li> <li>Suggestions are presented in a table format rather than as committable comments, which are far noisier</li> <li>The 'File Walkthrough' section is folded by default, as it tends to be verbose</li> <li>Intermediate comments are avoided when creating new PRs (like \"Qodo Merge is now reviewing your PR...\"), which would generate email noise</li> </ul> <p>From our experience, especially in large teams or organizations, complaints about \"noise\" sometimes stem from the following issues:</p> <ul> <li>Feedback from multiple bots: When multiple bots provide feedback on the same PR, it creates confusion and noise. We recommend using Qodo Merge as the primary feedback tool to streamline the process and reduce redundancy.</li> <li>Getting familiar with the tool: Unlike many tools that provide feedback only on demand, Qodo Merge automatically analyzes and suggests improvements for every code change. While this proactive approach can feel intimidating at first, it's designed to continuously enhance code quality and catch bugs and problems when they occur. We recommend reviewing this guide to help align expectations and maximize the value of Qodo Merge's auto-feedback.</li> </ul> <p>Therefore, at a global configuration level, we recommend using the default configuration, which is designed to reduce noise while providing valuable feedback.</p> <p>However, if you still find the feedback too noisy, you can adjust the configuration. Since each user and team has different needs, it's definitely possible - and even recommended - to adjust configurations for specific repos as needed. Ways to adjust the configuration for noise reduction include for example:</p> <ul> <li>Score thresholds for code suggestions</li> <li>Utilizing the <code>extra_instructions</code> field for more tailored feedback</li> <li>Controlling which tools run automatically</li> </ul> <p>Note that some users may prefer the opposite - more thorough and detailed feedback. Qodo Merge is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing you to tailor the feedback to your team's specific needs and preferences. Examples of ways to increase feedback include:</p> <ul> <li><code>Exhaustive</code> code suggestions</li> <li>Dual-publishing mode</li> <li>Interactive usage</li> </ul>"},{"location":"installation/","title":"Installation","text":""},{"location":"installation/#installation","title":"Installation","text":""},{"location":"installation/#self-hosted-pr-agent","title":"Self-hosted PR-Agent","text":"<p>There are several ways to use self-hosted PR-Agent:</p> <ul> <li>Locally</li> <li>GitHub integration</li> <li>GitLab integration</li> <li>BitBucket integration</li> <li>Azure DevOps integration</li> <li>Gitea integration</li> </ul>"},{"location":"installation/#qodo-merge","title":"Qodo Merge \ud83d\udc8e","text":"<p>Qodo Merge, an app hosted by QodoAI for GitHub\\GitLab\\BitBucket, is also available.

For example, in order to inject a secrets file as a volume in a Kubernetes environment you can update your pod spec to include the following, assuming you have a secret named <code>pr-agent-settings</code> with a key named <code>.secrets.toml</code>:</p> <pre><code>       volumes:\n        - name: settings-volume\n          secret:\n            secretName: pr-agent-settings\n// ...\n       containers:\n// ...\n          volumeMounts:\n            - mountPath: /app/pr_agent/settings_prod\n              name: settings-volume\n</code></pre> <p>Another option is to set the secrets as environment variables in your deployment environment, for example <code>OPENAI.KEY</code> and <code>GITHUB.USER_TOKEN</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>6) Build a Docker image for the app and optionally push it to a Docker repository.

In contrast, most open-source models currently available (as of January 2025) face challenges with these complex tasks.</p> <p>Based on our testing, local open-source models are suitable for experimentation and learning purposes (mainly for the <code>ask</code> command), but they are not suitable for production-level code analysis tasks.</p> <p>Hence, for production workflows and real-world usage, we recommend using commercial models.</p>"},{"location":"usage-guide/changing_a_model/#hugging-face","title":"Hugging Face","text":"<p>To use a new model with Hugging Face Inference Endpoints, for example, set:</p> <pre><code>[config] #
